  <header>The Blessed Curse of Ignorance<time></time>
  
  </header><p>I know not what lies ahead or how to stop it. I know only that I hold a great amount of fear in preparation for it. Everything seems to be crashing down. People worry but I myself am coldly watching. At the same time, I am very much involved in every messy detail. I rock back and forth as the colors seep off of me and I am left in black and white. Every anxious night of noise and anger and Isaac was better than this. Every night of numb, unfeeling darkness was better than this. Anything, quite frankly, seems better than knowing that you are going insane. No one fears that I am going insane worse than I do, though others seem to think they know how I feel. "I had anxiety attacks when I was younger," "I have depression," they say. Those people don't know the horror of voices not quite their own whispering in their heads. They do not know the shrieks I sometimes feel when looking in a dark doorway or into a mirror for too long. I am going insane, and whether or not they can stop it, it won't have been in time. I will never be the same, never fully recover. Everyone asks if I've had a traumatic experience. Well here it is. I am terrorized by my own brain. I am on guard as my own parents treat me like I'm on suicide watch. Soon I will go away, to where the songs say the men all in white are. On a more serious note, I'm not sure when I'll come back, and what I'll be like. Hell, I don't even know what I've told my friends. Part of me hopes they don't care. Another part hopes they do and always will.</p>
