She’s… She’s… wow.
<br> <br>
I try again, remembering, thinking, feeling, all the air that she’s stealing, the things I’m believing…
<br> <br>
She. She is how.
<br> <br>
How what? How I’m smiling so often, singing all these songs that I thought were gone, lost in my mind, but hey, that’s fine, they’re love songs and I’m singing along, but I’m not saying, I’m feeling, and she’s stealing…
<br> <br>
She is how I breathe, what I need, how I see.
<br> <br>
My breath. She has stolen my breath, and I’m sure a few other things are gone too, but those, I gave her. My mind. It slaves over her. It’s 8 at night, and every light is on. The songs are singing in my head. She’s in bed, I’m sure, but I won’t rest, can’t rest, not yet…
<br> <br>
She is my air, she fills my lungs and my head which was so empty. She is reminding me of life. 
<br> <br>
I cannot, will not sleep, but keep this image of her, en mon coeur, and always sing. That’s the thing, these words don’t fit, there’s no music. But she, she is music enough. In this dance of commas, letters, so glad I met her, to have my thoughts dashed like this. But with her there is something to think.
<br> <br>
God, Alexia, do you remember the snow? And hot chocolate! Storms, warmth, protection, books, those looks, the way it feels to be seen! And admired. Don’t you feel beautiful? Funny how that word makes you think of her now.
<br> <br>
I have two streams of thought, one me, one you, but what to do? Write and feel, give and steal, for you stole my breath away.</h5>
