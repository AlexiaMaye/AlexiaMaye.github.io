    <h4 id="poem">For that one night, I took a shower, put on pajamas, and got in bed. I listened to a CD to go to sleep, set my alarm, imagined I had a whole world to face tomorrow, but it was standing with me -
<br>My world.
<br>And I imagined I was strong without the little pills that let in little thoughts and give me little shakes and make me feel so little.
<br>I was tall and I was happy, and it wasnâ€™t me and I was wrong to do it.
