    <h4 id="poem">For that one night, I took a shower, put on pajamas, and got in bed. I listened to a CD to go to sleep, set my alarm, imagined I had a whole world to face tomorrow, but it was standing with me -
<br>My world.
<br>And I imagined I was strong without the little pills that let in little thoughts and give me little shakes and make me feel so little.
<br>I was tall and I was happy, and it wasn’t me and I was wrong to do it.

      <h4 id="poem">
I’ve found a star to call my own <br>
Alone in the night sky.<br>
She’s brighter than the rest<br>
Without having to try.<br>
<br><br>
She’s a shooting star<br>
But she hasn’t burnt out yet.<br>
On this temporary flame<br>
My heart is fully set.<br>
<br><br>
I have no reason to call her mine,<br>
Yet she shines on me alone.<br>
She’s more than a possession<br>
And they’re dirty words, “I own.”<br>
<br><br>
I’ve wished on her too many times<br>
To separate my soul<br>
From this star that shines so bright<br>
And makes me feel whole.<br>
<br><br>
The star waits for me and I for her,<br>
Until the end of time and after.<br>
